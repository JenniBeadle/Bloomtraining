title: 4 Big book
---

**Introduction**  
In this module we will learn how to create a big book using Bloom.

We will continue to use the new **Basic Book** template (even though there is an old template for creating a Big Book). With the Basic Book template we can create a large book and also the same book in A6 format from a single file. In fact, it is easier to start with the A6 book and then print it at A4 landscape.

**What will you do?**  
- We will first create a new A6 book.
- Then we will publish it in simple A4 format.

## 4.1 Creating a basic A6 book

- Start Bloom
- Create a Basic Book (see Chapter 2)
- Check the page size is A6
- Edit the book

## 4.2 Complete the book as desired

Fill in
- the cover
- the title page
- Add the pages
- Add text
- Change the images
- Fill in the credits page.

## 4.3 Publish - Simple option

To print it as a Big Book, you publish it using the Simple option on A4 paper.

To make an even bigger Big Book, you can photocopy it onto A3 paper.
