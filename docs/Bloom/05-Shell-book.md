title: 5 Shell Books
---



**Introduction**  
In this module, we will learn how to create a shell book (in French) that others can use to create books in their own languages.

**Where are we now?**  
You have already made books in a vernacular collection. Now we are going to learn how to make books in a source collection. We can share these books with others to make them in their languages.

**Why is this important?**  
In Bloom, there are two types of collections. A vernacular collection contains books for a specific language. A source collection contains books in a language like French. Then books that can be shared and translated into vernacular languages.

When you want to create a book that others can translate into their own language, you have to create them in a source collection so that they can be shared with a Bloom pack.

**What will you do?**
- First we will create a new source collection and then create a shell book.
- Then we will make a Bloom pack for this collection that can be sent to others to create books in their language.
