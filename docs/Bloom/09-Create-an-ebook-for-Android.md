title: 9 Create an e-book (for Android)
---

**Introduction**  
Bloom can also create eBooks that can be read on an Android smartphone using the Bloom Reader app. This module explains how to format your book for Android and also how to transfer the book to the phone.

**Where are we now?**  
You have created a book that you want to copy to your Android device. To do this you need to download and install Bloom Reader on your phone.

**Why is this important?**  
E-books are cheaper to produce, however, you need an application that can read them. Bloom Reader was written specifically to read Bloom books on an Android smartphone. As the screen size is very different from the paper size, you must format it first before you can send it to your phone.

**What will you do?**  
- First you need to download and install Bloom Reader from the Google Playstore.
- Then you open your book and reformat it to fit an Android screen
- Then you publish the book to your Android device.

If it does not, make the necessary changes to the problem pages.
