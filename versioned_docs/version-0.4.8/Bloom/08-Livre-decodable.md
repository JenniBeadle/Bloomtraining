title: 8 Decodable book
---

**Introduction**  
In this module we will learn how to create a decodable book in Bloom (i.e. a book that contains only the learned letters (or sight words)).

**Why is this important?**  
When people start learning to read, they need a lot of practice with reading material that contains only the letters (or sight words) they have learned so far. Without a program like Bloom, it is very difficult to ensure that your book is limited to known letters or sight words. Bloom's Decodable reader book allows us to introduce letters and sight words at different stages. When you make decodable books, Bloom will warn you whenever you use a word with letters that have not yet been learned (or that is not a sight word).

**What will you do?**  
- Create a book based on the decodable reader template.
- Set the stages by adding the graphemes, word list and letter and sight word definitions for each stage.
- Create a level 1 decodable reader book.
